        <h2>Video Games</h2>
          <div>
            <p>Recently I've been playing <span class="Games">Crying Suns</span> and <span class="Games">Epic Battle Fantasy 5</span>.</p>
            <p>Here are some things I like about the former:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Choices matter</li>
              <li>Story is deep and engaging</li>
              <li>Sci-fi elements are written in a logical manner</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here are things that I like about the latter:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Hilarious dialogue</li>
              <li>Lots of vaible strategies in combat</li>
              <li>Old RPG style but introduces really cool new mechanics</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <aside>Disclaimer: I'm by no means a hardcore gamer of any kind.</aside>

            <p>I also like lots of Nintendo games, such as Pokemon Platinum and Fire Emblem Fates.</p>
